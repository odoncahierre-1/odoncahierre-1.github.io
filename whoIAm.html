        My name is Odon Cahierre. Born in Paris, I've lived in Japan and Los Angeles throughout my
        life and am now a student at Cornell University. I am very interested in environmental
        science and especially the environmental problems surrounding transportation of all things. I
        hope to use my international background to help solve environmental problems in the U.S. and
        abroad. While my main passion are these environmental problems, I always like to challenge
        myself with new projects and explore my creativity. I built this website to further my understanding of web
        design and to have a platform where all my different endevours can be accessed. This page is
        where my resume, social media, and other information about me can be accessed.
